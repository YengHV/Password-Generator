Generate a password that the user is able to choose to have uppercase, numbers, and symbols in the password. 
I started with qsuedo coding
after that I gave varibles to the characters. 
1st prompt is asking how long the user would like the password to be.
2nd prompt is asking if user would like numbers were including.
3rd prompt is asking if user would like symbols or special chracters.
I started my if statments after that.
unfortunately, I was not able to figure out a for loop to generate the password.

New README

On page load, user is prompt to make choices.
Choices consist of password length if user would like upper case, lower case, numbers, or symbols.
Once user enter their choices, the webpage will take those choices and generate a password in the background.
The password will generate when the button "generate password" is clicked.
A random password will generate with the prompts that user entered.
I was able to get everything going correctly this time. 
Unfortunely, it could only generate once.
